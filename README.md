# Schedule Fixer

Firefox addon to overhaul Cal Poly's Schedule Builder

### Features:

* Mandatory dark theme (until I figure out how to best add this as an option)

* Shows correct professor for each section

  * I webscraped schedules.calpoly.edu for this - don't tell Jeff.

* Pulls polyratings for each professor

  * Calpolyratings will be supported when/if they reimplement actual professor grades.

* Removes "expand filters" and keeps it expanded.

  * I couldn't find how to add classes for the longest time, because it was hidden as a 'filter'


  I plan to add more to this, but with registration in the works, priority #1 was getting something minimally viable.
